### Usage

- Make your configs [global_config](./config_global.md) and [character_config](./config_character.md)
- Ideally position your character in hideout. Make sure your flasks have full charges.
- Run program with your configs

### Flasks

- Each time you change a flask in-game you have to restart the program. So for levelling when you are swappign flasks a lot you will have to restart the program each time and do it while your flasks have full charges (or at least 1).

### Skills

- If you want to auto-trigger skills the program needs to be launched while your are not in town (hideout etc.).
